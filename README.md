# RestAPI: TestAutomation (WIP)


Hi There! 

This project documents my journey in learning automated API Testing with Rest Assured using https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

JSONPlaceholder, a fake online REST API for testing and prototyping. It's a free, open-source project that provides a set of placeholder endpoints for common HTTP methods. 
JSONPlaceholder allows developers to simulate a backend server and interact with various API endpoints to test their applications without making actual requests to a real server.

Please take note that this project is currently under construction and will be subject to ongoing updates. Feel free to examine the codebase and inform me of any possible enhancements.

Thanks!
